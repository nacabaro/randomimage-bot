To create a list with the episodes, you can use the following command:
  find <route_to_path> | grep <file_extension> > <alias_of episodes>.txt

Being:
  -<route_to_path>: The route where the video files for the season
  are located.

  -<file_extension>: The file extension of the episodes in mind.
  this part is used to avoid getting files that are not the episodes
  (such as other files with different extensions, etc.)

  -<alias_of_episodes>: The name of the file which has the index of
  the episodes. This part is the one referenced by the database as to
  read from.
